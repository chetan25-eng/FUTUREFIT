# KBN – Job Matching Web App

## Project Description
KBN is a small web application that allows users to upload their resume or input data, processes the information, and compares it against scraped job listings. It then displays relevant job matches or recommendations in a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Upload resume/data through a web form.
- Backend logic parses and processes the input.
- Matches data against pre-scraped job postings (stored in `scraped_jobs.csv`).
- Displays results dynamically using HTML templates.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML (Jinja templates)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or similar web framework)
- **Data:** CSV file containing scraped jobs
- **Others:** File upload handling

## How It Works
1. User visits the home page (`index.html`).
2. Uploads a file or enters details.
3. `app.py` routes the request to the backend logic.
4. `backend_logic.py` processes and compares the data.
5. Results are displayed on the `answers.html` page.
